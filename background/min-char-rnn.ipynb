    "This notebook is actually just an annotated, updated-for-Python3 fork of [ONE of several explanatory gists in Torch neural networks, RNN, LSTM](https://gist.github.com/karpathy), specifically [**min-char-rnn.py](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086) which worked with Python2 and was written several years ago by [Andrej Karpathy](https://gist.github.com/karpathy) [Twitter@karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy). \n",

There are obviously plenty more of these out there -- maybe we can't look at them all but it's worth looking at more of these to see how they differ.\n",

That could be a question worth pondering if we are doing trillions of ephemeral installation of Python or Jupyter Notebooks.\n",

[`range()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range) replaced xrange() from Python2; xrange() no longer exists in Python3 because [xrange() is sequence object which evaluates *lazily*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/94935/what-is-the-difference-between-range-and-xrange-functions-in-python-2-x); thus, range() is ridiculously faster. \n",

    "This general principle of Python improving and making your old favorite code that was tuned to perfection and flawless the last time you used a day ago, into some kind of JUNK that is no longer supported, is a good reason to keep up with the latest Python3 dev list discussions in your RSS reader. ***Therefore, it's perhaps worth delving into the minutia just a bit in order to really understand data I/O.***\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we use the [`open()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) ... works with [read() method](https://peps.python.org/pep-3116/), which if unspecified or specified with empty brackets which defaults to the -1 index to start load from the very beginning to take in the whole file text file from start to finish ... we could choose another parameter for read() like 60 ... to ignore the first 60 chars of data ... maybe to debug how out code processes the data differently if we ignore a big part of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a Function like [`open()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) is a block of code that accomplishes a certain task and runs when it is called. We can pass data, known as parameters, into a Function and a Function can return data as well ... A Function inside a class and associated with an object or class is called a Method ... to use a Method, we need to call the Method just like  we use a Function but since Methods are associated with class/object, we would need to use a class/object name and [a dot operator](https://www.askpython.com/python/built-in-methods/dot-notation) to call the Method ... thus the period before the r in `read()` in the `open('input.txt', 'r').read()` call \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the Functions and Methods... you can play around with the [simple text file **input.txt**](input.txt) ... which the following `open()` function uses to see how it affects what comes thereafter ... the first cells process quickly, but you might want to leave that last cell run for a while to see what happens."
