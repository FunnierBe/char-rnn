Change it up!

This text file can be ANYTHING of your choosing ... change it up and try different inputs or approach the algorithm with different ideas.

Perhaps, you might want to have the algorithm analyze the text what others are reading, ie, you could copy the text of a book from the Gutenberg project.

Or you could use text from from Wikipedia ... or a body of science or engineering that you know ... or maybe the Python-Dev mailing list archives, such as https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/latest 

Or might want to analyze meta-data, such as a json file from the Twitter API ... or text that is about text, eg, the Classics most frequently downloaded in the last 30 days at the Gutenberg.org.
